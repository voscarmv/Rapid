<h1 align="center">Rapid</h1>

Rapid is a web-based modern editor for [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). Rapid integrates advanced mapping tools, authoritative geospatial open data, and cutting-edge technology to empower mappers at all levels to get started quickly, making accurate and fresh edits to maps.

Rapid is enhanced with authoritative open data sources and AI-generated roads from the Facebook Map With AI service + buildings from Microsoft open buildings dataset to make adding and editing roads, buildings, and more quick and simple.

Rapid also includes data integrity checks to ensure that new map edits are consistent and accurate. To learn about all the enhanced features Rapid provides, please check out our [Change Log](CHANGELOG.md) and [training document](https://github.com/facebookmicrosites/Open-Mapping-At-Facebook/wiki#editing-in-rapid).
